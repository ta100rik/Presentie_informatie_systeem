#GroupProject2019


Basic repo containing the initial prototype application for HU's educational program for Software Development, more specifically Group Project 2019

This is a *Polymer* application, based on *bower* running on *npm*

Before running the application class as a Java Application execute the instructions as mentioned in webapp/todo.md and webapp/app/todo.md, they will inform you to run *bower update* as well as *polymer lint* on said locations. This will take quite a while.

After these steps you can run controller.Application as a Java Application and navigate to [http://localhost:8888 "http://localhost:8888"]
